# A Data Sorting and Searching Program by Java

This program is designed to help users sort (bubble sort, heap sort, or merge sort) and search(linear and binary tree search) through their data files. 

The user could give a specific txt data file as input, and the program will read and store those data in a well-designed Array-List Collection. Editing is provided after data are stored. Using linear to search if a certain target is in the dataset. Afterward, users could choose either bubble sort, heap sort, or merge sort algorithm to sort their data. If the user wants to use BST search, they could also select it after the data is sorted. To ensure the best performance, the BST search will convert your data to a balanced binary search tree and then execute the search process.

Processing Steps:
Entering data file → Editing the data → Linear search → Sort data → BST search

For users' convenience, the system will report the timing of the sort or search process.

A data generator was also provided to help users create random data for specific sizes (see Data Generation folder in source codes). It contains three different algorithms to generate either string, integer, or float data. The single datum length and the data file size could be set manually.
