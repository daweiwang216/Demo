# Recommender System

This part contains Jupyter notebooks and datasets that start from data processing analysis to building up regression-based prediction models, simple popularity-based prediction models, neighborhood models, content-based filtering models, and parameter tuning for recommender systems, with some utility packs that help with calculating similarities and KNN recommender, etc.

The recommender systems were coded directly by python with numpy and pandas. The usage of SciKit Surprise is also demonstrated in separate examples.
