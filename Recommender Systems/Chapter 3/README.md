# Chapter 3

Chapter 3.1 focuses on content-based filtering methods for recommendation. It shows how to create feature vector representation with TFxIDF weights, use NLTK to normalize documents, and create a non-personalized and personalized content-based recommender. 

Chapter 3.2 focuses on parameter tuning for recommender systems implemented in Surprise. It compares the performances of one neighborhood algorithm and two model-based algorithms. Manuel search and grid search were used here.
