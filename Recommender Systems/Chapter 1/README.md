# Chapter 1

This chapter aims to ensure that the computer has everything you need to be installed and working properly. It shows the whole process directly, from EDA and dataset manipulation to building up the regression-based models. Then, it builds up a class for the non-personalized model and uses the Scikit Surprise package for recommender systems.
